                    <p>Firstly, I am the father of three beautiful children. I have one boy and two girls and their names are Isaac (10), Zoe (4), and Ezra (18 mos). Their mother's name is Jessica and I am proud to say that I have been lucky enough to be married to her for nearly 11 years, and we have been in Austin for all of that time.</p>

                    <p>Leading up to the coding bootcamp, I was in the service industry for the past 16 years, 11 of which were with Hyatt Regency Austin, and 8 of those years I led the Banquet Beverage department. I tell people that I had the best bar job in Austin, and I firmly believe that.</p>
                    
                    <p>I left a job and friends that I loved because I wanted to find an industy that would allow me to spend nights and weekends at home with my family, and I have a genuine joy for the challenge that is coding. I look forward to forging the same kinds of relationships and love for my work that I previously enjoyed.</p>
